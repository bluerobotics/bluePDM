### Fixed
- Files not uploading after app restart due to 1000-file query limit on initial sync

---

## [1.5.0] - 2025-12-11

### Added
- **Trash View** in sidebar:
  - View all soft-deleted files from your vaults
  - Restore deleted files back to active status
  - Permanently delete files (removes from database and storage)
  - Empty trash to permanently delete all trashed files at once
  - Search and filter deleted files
  - Shows who deleted each file and when
  - Filter by vault when multiple vaults connected
- **New logging system**: Comprehensive session logs with timestamps, log levels, and structured data for easier debugging
- **Drag & drop from external apps**: Drag files/folders from Windows Explorer directly into BluePDM to import them

### Improved
- **Major performance improvements** for all file operations (check-in, check-out, download, upload)
- **First app boot experience**: Faster initial load, better vault validation, improved auth flow
- **Thumbnail resizing**: Fixed thumbnails not updating properly when changing icon/row sizes
- **Drag & drop reliability**: Fixed various drag operation bugs and edge cases

### Fixed
- **First check-in files not persisting after restart**: Files that were previously deleted from the server would appear to upload successfully but show as "local only" after app restart. Now re-uploading previously deleted files properly clears the soft-delete flag (`deleted_at`), restoring them to active status.
- **Case-sensitive path matching on Windows**: File paths are now matched case-insensitively when syncing with the server, fixing issues where files wouldn't be recognized as synced due to case differences between the filesystem and database.
- **Drag & drop bugs**: Fixed files not dropping correctly in certain scenarios
- **Thumbnail sizing issues**: Thumbnails now properly scale with slider adjustments

## [1.4.0] - 2025-12-10

### Added

  - PDF, Excel, and other files show their Windows application icons
  - Falls back to React icons only when OS icons unavailable
  - Thumbnails now work in both icon view AND list view
- **List View Row Size Slider**:
  - Adjustable row height (16-64px) in list view
  - Icon size scales with row size for better visibility
  - Thumbnails/icons appear in list view when rows are large enough
- **Vault User Permissions** (admin-only):
  - Per-vault access control - restrict which users can access specific vaults

  - Admins always have access to all vaults
  - Unrestricted vaults remain accessible to all members (legacy behavior)
  - New `vault_access` database table with RLS policies

  - Exclude files/folders from sync using glob patterns (like .gitignore)
