// Vault file watcher.
//
// Two backends behind one interface:
//
// - Windows and macOS use a single native recursive fs.watch handle, which the OS
//   sets up in constant time. Measured against a 27,600-entry vault: chokidar took
//   194,928ms to reach `ready` while saturating the main process event loop the whole
//   time, and fs.watch({ recursive: true }) took 0ms. That stall was what made the
//   startup vault scan take 35-40s instead of ~1s.
// - Linux keeps chokidar. Node supports recursive watching there, but through a
//   userspace implementation that walks the tree the same way chokidar does, so there
//   is nothing to gain and a working watcher to lose.
//
// The native backend has to reconstruct what chokidar handed us for free: the
// add/change/unlink/addDir/unlinkDir distinction, and awaitWriteFinish.
