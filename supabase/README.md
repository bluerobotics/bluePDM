# BluePLM Database Schema

This folder contains the modular database schema for BluePLM. The schema is organized into a core foundation, two modules that are always required (`10-source-files.sql` and `15-inspection.sql`), and optional feature modules.

## Architecture

## Fresh Installation

Run these SQL files in order in your Supabase SQL Editor:

### 1. Core (Required)

```sql
-- Run core.sql first - this creates the foundation
```

### 2. Modules (Run in numeric order)

```sql
-- 10-source-files.sql   - Required: file management
-- 15-inspection.sql     - Required: inspection tables (see below - checkin_file needs them)
-- 20-change-control.sql - Optional: ECOs, reviews, deviations
-- 30-supply-chain.sql   - Optional: Suppliers, RFQs
-- 40-integrations.sql   - Optional: Webhooks, external integrations, credential store
-- 50-extensions.sql     - Optional: extension system and extension secret store
-- 60-customers.sql      - Optional: Odoo customer sync, AI enrichment
```

Numeric order (`core → 10 → 15 → 20 → 30 → 40 → 50 → 60`) always works. Skipping a
module is only safe if it is marked Optional above.

### 3. Nothing — the last file records the version

Every file above ends by asking to be verified, so the last one you apply prints
`Schema verified and stamped at version 96` and the install is done. The earlier ones
print `Schema version not stamped: N outstanding item(s)`, which is what a file applied
before the rest of the release is supposed to say.

Run `tools/verify-schema.sql` when that last line does *not* appear. It is the same
check with the full object-by-object report, and it ends with an error rather than a
notice, so it cannot scroll past unnoticed. The schema files themselves never raise —
an exception in the Supabase SQL editor would roll back the file that had just been
applied successfully. See [Schema Version](#schema-version).

> **15-inspection.sql is not optional.** `checkin_file()` — the check-in RPC, defined in
> `10-source-files.sql` — reads `inspection_characteristics` and writes
> `inspection_characteristic_versions` on every call, unconditionally and for every file
> type, not just drawings. Both tables live in `15-inspection.sql`. Leaving it out still
> *installs* cleanly, because PostgreSQL does not resolve table names inside a `plpgsql`
> body until the function runs; the database then accepts every check-in attempt and fails
> with `relation "inspection_characteristics" does not exist`. Install `15` whenever you
> install `10`.

### What actually constrains the order

Two different kinds of dependency are in play, and only one of them shows up as an
install error:

- **Install-time.** `15`, `20` and `30` declare foreign keys against `files`, so they
  abort immediately with `relation "files" does not exist` if `10-source-files.sql` has
  not been run. `40`, `50` and `60` have no such link and install on bare `core.sql`.
- **Run-time.** Function bodies are only parsed for syntax at creation. A function that
  queries a table from a module you skipped installs happily and fails on first call.
  This is the `checkin_file` → `15-inspection.sql` case above, and it is the reason
  "installed without errors" is not the same as "working".

Beyond that, `20`, `30`, `40`, `50` and `60` do not depend on one another and may be
installed in any relative order — verified by installing them in different orders and
diffing the resulting schema. The only difference is the physical column order of
`organizations`, which several modules extend with `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`; that is
cosmetic, but it does mean `INSERT` statements without an explicit column list are unsafe
against this schema.

## Schema Version

The app reads `schema_version.version` on startup and warns if it does not match
`EXPECTED_SCHEMA_VERSION` in `src/lib/schemaVersion.ts`.

- Current schema version: **101** (keep in sync with `schema_release_version()` in `core.sql`)
- The number is written by **verification only**: `verify_and_stamp_schema()` checks the
  release manifest in `core.sql`, and every security check, and stamps the version only if
  all of it holds.
- Every schema file asks it to, via `try_stamp_schema()`, so the version is recorded by
  whichever file you happen to apply last. No file can advance the version on its own
  account.

### Upgrading

Apply `core.sql`, then the modules, in the usual order — the last one records the version.
Order does not actually matter, because the answer is computed from the whole database
rather than from the file that asked; what matters is that the file carrying your change
is among the ones you apply. Applying a single module is enough to move the version, and
only if the rest of the database is already at this release.

### Why a file no longer stamps a version as a side effect

Until 89, `core.sql` and each module stamped the head version as a side effect of being
run. That could not be right, because the number is one global value while the files are
per-module: nothing in `30-supply-chain.sql` can know what state `10-source-files.sql` is
in. Three things followed from it, all reproduced in a container:

- Applying **only** `30-supply-chain.sql` to a v86 database recorded 88 while module 10's
  v87 work was absent. The app compared 88 against its own 88 and showed no warning at
  all, so a known configuration-wipe bug kept running under a green light.
- Re-running `core.sql` alone on a v86 database forced the record to 88 with neither v87
  nor v88 present, because its `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` was neither monotonic
  nor guarded.
- Under the `psql \i` path in [modules/README.md](modules/README.md), a module that
  errored partway through still reached its stamp at the end of the file. (The Supabase
  SQL editor wraps each run in a transaction and rolls back, so this only ever affected
  the CLI path.)

The scheme now has one property, and it is the only one worth having: **the recorded
version can only be reached by verification, so it never describes a database that does
not exist.** A partial application leaves the old number in place, which shows up as
"database out of date" — a warning you can act on rather than a false all-clear.

Note what that property does *not* require. It says the number must be **earned**; it says
nothing about which file may ask for it. A file asking to be verified at the end of its own
run is safe for the same reason `tools/verify-schema.sql` is — the check reads the whole
database, so the answer cannot depend on who asked, and a file applied before the rest of
the release is simply told no. What was never safe was a file stamping *because it had been
run*, which is a claim about seven files it cannot see.

So the convenience is back and the defect is not. Applying the files advances the version
with no separate step, exactly as before 89; the three failures listed above now all end in
a refusal instead of a false all-clear, because in each case the database really was short
of the release and the manifest says so.

`check_schema_release()` is read-only and can be called on its own at any time to see
what a database is missing without writing anything.

When making schema changes:

1. Update the appropriate file (`core.sql` or `modules/*.sql`)
2. Bump `schema_release_version()` in `core.sql`
3. Add anything new to `schema_release_manifest()` in `core.sql`, so verification can see
   it. A body change with no new object can be pinned with the `requires` column, which
   asserts a substring of the function source
4. Update `src/lib/schemaVersion.ts` with the same number and a description

## Regenerating TypeScript Types

After making schema changes, regenerate the TypeScript types:

```bash
npm run gen:types
```

This requires `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` in your `.env` file:

```env
SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

Get your token from: https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens

## Tools

### Reset Script

⚠️ **WARNING: This will DELETE ALL DATA!**

Use `tools/reset.sql` to completely wipe the database before a fresh install:

```sql
-- Run tools/reset.sql to drop all tables, functions, types, etc.
-- Then run core.sql + modules in order
```

### Verification Script

`tools/verify-schema.sql` is the last step of every install and upgrade, not an optional
health check. It reports:

- All expected tables exist
- Key functions are present
- RLS is enabled on all tables
- Every `SECURITY DEFINER` RPC taking a `p_org_id` consults the caller's identity, and
  none of them is executable by `PUBLIC` (see [Org-scoped RPCs](#org-scoped-rpcs))
- The release manifest, object by object
- …and then stamps the schema version if all of that holds

On a complete, correct install every check passes and it prints `Schema verified and
stamped at version 91`. If it refuses to stamp, it names the objects that are missing or
stale and the module each belongs to; run those files and run it again.

One kind of report is deliberately *not* a reason to withhold the stamp. On Supabase there
is a default-privilege entry owned by `supabase_admin` that grants `EXECUTE` on new
functions to `anon`, and no role available to a project can alter it. Version 90 treated
that as fatal, which meant a database with every object correctly installed could never be
stamped, and the failure told the operator to run the function that had just been unable to
change it. It is now reported as advisory. It has no effect on anything that already
exists — everything shipped is revoked by name — and its actual consequence, that a
function created by some later migration is born reachable by `anon`, is caught by name in
the same check.

The `Missing functions: generate_rfq_number` report this script used to produce was real
rather than stale — `30-supply-chain.sql` had not created that function since
`schema.sql` was split into modules, so creating an RFQ failed on every correctly
installed database. The function is back in that module as of schema version 88.

## Org-scoped RPCs

A `SECURITY DEFINER` function runs as the schema owner, so row-level security is not
consulted inside it. When such a function also takes a `p_org_id`, that argument decides
which organization it acts on — and PostgREST exposes it to whoever holds `EXECUTE`.
A newly created function grants `EXECUTE` to `PUBLIC`, which includes `anon`, so a
`GRANT EXECUTE ... TO authenticated` written beside a new function looks like a
restriction and is not one. On Supabase it is worse than that: the bootstrap runs

```sql
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
  GRANT ALL ON FUNCTIONS TO postgres, anon, authenticated, service_role;
```

which *adds* an explicit `anon=X/postgres` on top of the built-in `PUBLIC` default. Version
89 tried to close this with `REVOKE ... FROM PUBLIC`, which strips only the implicit entry
and leaves the explicit grant to `anon` in place — so it removed nothing, on a platform
where it needed to remove everything. Naming the role is the only thing that revokes it.
`revoke_public_execute_on_org_rpcs()` was that attempt and is gone.

Three things handle it now:

- Every such function calls `require_org_member(p_org_id)` first, which raises unless
  `auth.uid()` belongs to that organization. An unknown organization id gets the same
  authorization error as one the caller is not a member of, so the function cannot be
  used to find out which ids are real; `NULL` gets its own message.
- `enforce_anon_execute_posture()` runs at the end of `core.sql` and every module. It
  withdraws `EXECUTE` from `anon` **by name** on everything in `public` except a short
  pre-login allowlist, and does the same for views and materialized views. It is applied
  by class rather than function by function because these modules `DROP` and re-`CREATE`
  functions, which resets the ACL on every install, and because the class keeps covering
  objects added later.
- `check_anon_reach()` then refuses to certify a database where anything outside that
  allowlist is still reachable. This is the part that has to be structural, because the
  sweep cannot be made permanent: `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` cannot cancel the built-in
  `PUBLIC EXECUTE` default at all, and the `supabase_admin` entry is beyond a project's
  reach. A function created by a later ad-hoc migration therefore *is* born reachable by
  `anon`. Nothing prevents that; verification catches it.

### Gating the argument that selects the row

`require_org_member(p_org_id)` only proves the caller belongs to the organization they
named. If a second argument chooses the row, that argument needs checking too.
`create_file_share_link` did not do this: it took `p_org_id` and `p_file_id`, verified the
first and inserted the second, so a member of any organization could mint a share token for
another tenant's file. Functions in this position either compare the entity's own `org_id`
to `p_org_id`, or drop `p_org_id` as an authority altogether and derive the organization
from the entity with `require_file_access()` / `require_vault_access()`.
`check_unbound_entity_args()` reports a function that gates on `p_org_id` and then never
uses it to constrain anything.

### Membership tests must be NULL-safe

An account that has signed up but not joined an organization has `users.org_id` set to
`NULL`. That makes

```sql
IF p_org_id NOT IN (SELECT org_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()) THEN
```

evaluate to `NULL` rather than true, so the `IF` is not taken and the body runs against
whatever organization was named. Nine of these shipped in v90. Use
`require_org_member(p_org_id)`, or `NOT is_org_member(p_org_id)` where the function returns
a value instead of raising. `check_null_unsafe_org_gates()` scans for the shape and refuses
to certify a database that contains it — including in a position where some other condition
currently happens to cover it, because a gate whose correctness depends on a neighbouring
check is not a gate.

### Views

A view has no row-level security of its own, and unless it is created
`WITH (security_invoker = true)` it reads its underlying tables as its owner, so their
policies do not apply either. `parts_with_pricing` was neither, and was readable by `anon`:
every organization's part numbers, descriptions, revisions, preferred suppliers and unit
prices, with no JWT. New views in `public` should be `security_invoker` and granted to
`authenticated`/`service_role` only. Both `check_anon_reach()` and
`tools/emergency-lockdown.sql` cover views and materialized views.

Three functions are exempt from the membership check and named in `verify-schema.sql`:
`create_default_job_titles`, `create_default_permission_teams` and
`seed_customer_categories` all run from `AFTER INSERT` triggers on `organizations`, when
the new organization has no members and a membership check could only fail. They are not
endpoints, and the verification script fails if any of them is reachable by `PUBLIC`.

## Migration from Monolithic Schema

The previous monolithic `schema.sql` (8,500+ lines) has been replaced by this modular architecture. The migration:

- Splits functionality into logical modules
- Maintains full backward compatibility
- Allows selective feature installation
- Improves maintainability and code organization

If you have an existing database, no migration is needed - the modular files produce the same schema as the original.
