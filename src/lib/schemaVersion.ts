/**
 * Schema Version Checking
 *
 * Detects mismatches between the app's expected database schema version
 * and the actual schema version in the database. This helps users understand
 * when their organization's database needs to be updated.
 *
 * VERSION HISTORY:
 * - Version 1: Initial schema version tracking (v2.15.0)
 * - Version 2: Added workflow_roles, job_titles, pending_org_members, vault_users (v2.16.0)
 * - Version 3: Added auth_providers to organizations for SSO control (v2.16.6)
 *
 * DATABASE SCHEMA LOCATION:
 * The schema is now modular - see supabase/README.md for details:
 * - supabase/core.sql - Foundation (orgs, users, teams, permissions)
 * - supabase/modules/*.sql - Feature modules (source files, change control, etc.)
 *
 * WHAT THE NUMBER IN THE DATABASE MEANS (schema 89 onwards):
 * schema_version.version is written by one thing only - verify_and_stamp_schema(),
 * called from supabase/tools/verify-schema.sql - and only after it has confirmed
 * that the objects the release requires are actually present. Running a file no
 * longer stamps anything. Before 89 both core.sql and each module stamped the
 * head unconditionally, so applying one module to an old database recorded a
 * version the database was not at and this check reported "up to date" over a
 * half-applied schema. The comparison below is worth acting on because the number
 * it reads can now only be reached by verification.
 *
 * Version 0 is the value core.sql seeds and means "never verified", which is not
 * the same as "old" - see the dbVersion === 0 branch below.
 *
 * When making schema changes:
 * 1. Increment EXPECTED_SCHEMA_VERSION here
 * 2. Update the appropriate module file in supabase/ (core.sql or modules/*.sql)
 * 3. Bump schema_release_version() in supabase/core.sql to match, and add any
 *    new object to schema_release_manifest() there so verification can see it
 * 4. Add entry to VERSION_DESCRIPTIONS below
 * 5. This file and schema_release_version() in supabase/core.sql must agree

  86: 'Workflow diagrams save their layout: node size on workflow_states, endpoint anchors, waypoints and label placement on workflow_transitions, plus execute_workflow_transition/complete_gate_review as the single atomic path a file takes through a workflow, an auditable workflow_history and file_state_entries, and the removal of ten never-wired advanced workflow tables',
  87: 'checkin_file merges the reserved per-configuration maps in custom_properties entry by entry instead of replacing them wholesale, so checking in one edited configuration no longer erases every configuration the user did not touch',
  88: 'generate_rfq_number exists again: creating an RFQ called it over RPC but no module had created it since schema.sql was split into modules, so every attempt failed on a correctly installed database. It allocates RFQ-<year>-<sequence> from a per-organization counter table rather than deriving the number from existing RFQs, which two clients could otherwise read as the same value before either had inserted anything',
  89: 'A SECURITY DEFINER function that takes a p_org_id now proves the caller belongs to that organization instead of taking the argument at its word: RLS does not apply inside such a function and a new function is executable by PUBLIC, so anon could allocate another organization\u2019s next RFQ number or list its files by naming its id. Thirteen functions gained require_org_member(), three that run from organization-creation triggers were withdrawn from PUBLIC instead, and the schema version is now written only by supabase/tools/verify-schema.sql after it confirms the release\u2019s objects exist - running core.sql or a single module no longer stamps a version the database is not at',
  90: 'Closes unauthenticated access. Supabase grants EXECUTE on every function in public to anon by default, so the REVOKE ... FROM PUBLIC that v89 relied on removed nothing and all 159 functions stayed callable without logging in; the roles are now named explicitly, the default privilege that recreates the grant is withdrawn, and supabase/tools/emergency-lockdown.sql applies the same closure to a running database without waiting for a schema upgrade. Functions that reach an organization through an entity id rather than a p_org_id argument - checkout_file, checkin_file, move_file, rename_folder_files, the workflow transitions, the licence and ECO functions - now resolve the organization from the entity and check membership against it, and take the acting user from auth.uid() instead of the p_user_id the caller supplies, so the audit trail records who actually called. Verification changed from advisory to blocking: it calls each org-scoped function with a foreign organization id and requires a refusal rather than reading the source for the words, notices leftover overloads that a DROP by exact signature missed, and refuses to stamp a database that is reachable by anon',
  91: 'Fixes four cross-tenant holes v90 left, and the reason v90 could never be recorded. v90 could not stamp on a real Supabase project at all: its anon check treated a default-privilege entry owned by supabase_admin as fatal, and no project role can alter that entry, so a correctly installed database was told to run the very function that had just failed and the app showed "database out of date" for ever. That entry is now advisory - it cannot affect anything that already exists, only functions a later migration creates, which the check still catches by name. parts_with_pricing was readable with the publishable anon key and returned every organization\u2019s part numbers, descriptions, revisions, suppliers and unit prices: a view has no RLS of its own and this one was not security_invoker, so it read its tables as its owner. It is security_invoker now, and views and materialized views are swept and checked alongside functions, which they never were. create_file_share_link checked p_org_id and then acted on p_file_id without ever comparing them, so a member of any organization could mint a working token for another tenant\u2019s file; it now derives the organization from the file. Nine membership tests written as p_org_id NOT IN (SELECT org_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()) evaluated to NULL rather than true for an account whose org_id is still NULL, so the refusal never fired and a new account could read another organization\u2019s Odoo configuration and integration status and overwrite and delete its item_images; all nine are gone, including the four an admin check happened to be covering. Share tokens come from a CSPRNG instead of random(), validate_share_link honours require_auth and no longer spends a download just to answer, get_org_auth_providers renders a hit and a miss identically so slugs cannot be enumerated, and rename_folder_files accepts a missing vault again by resolving it inside the caller\u2019s own organization rather than refusing',
  92: 'Makes verification winnable, and closes the shape v91 said it had closed. v91 could still be put into a state with no way out: its anon sweep only touched functions while its anon check looked at every routine, so a PROCEDURE added by a later migration was reported as blocking, the remedy the verifier printed changed nothing, and the stamp was withheld for ever - and any function in public owned by supabase_admin, which is what CREATE EXTENSION produces there, was graded the same way even though postgres cannot revoke it. The sweep now covers every kind of routine, an object nobody is permitted to revoke is reported in full but does not withhold the stamp, and BluePLM installs no extension at all: uuid-ossp is gone and every default that used uuid_generate_v4() now uses the built-in gen_random_uuid(), with existing columns rewritten on upgrade. A routine created after the sweep is also born unreachable by anon, which the previous release had concluded was impossible. apply_workflow_transition gated its file and then loaded a transition id with an existence test and nothing else, so a member of one organization could apply another tenant\u2019s transition to her own file and read that tenant\u2019s workflow, state and transition names out of her own history; the transition is now resolved through the file\u2019s organization, and the check meant to prevent this shape no longer starts from functions that take a p_org_id, so one that gates on an entity instead is finally visible to it. require_auth on a share link now means a member of the organization that owns the file, rather than any Supabase account, which - since signing up is free - restricted nobody. Three checks that certified more than they verified were tightened: the org-gate probe fills arguments with values a function can get past and only credits a refusal it can attribute to an authorization check, materialized views are covered, and the NULL-unsafe membership test is matched in every spelling including LANGUAGE sql. rename_folder_files escapes LIKE metacharacters, so a folder called 100% renames itself and nothing else',
  93: 'Closing a hole and revoking what the hole produced now travel together. Every release before this one was verified only against a fresh install, where there is no history for a fix to fail to undo, so no release had ever been asked whether it cleans up after itself - and applied over a database that had run v90 and been attacked, v92 left a share link minted by one organization\u2019s member against another organization\u2019s file still answering is_valid: true to an unauthenticated caller and still spending downloads, surviving because of the fix rather than despite it, with verification reporting the schema clean. Applying the schema now deactivates those links and redacts workflow history that names another organization\u2019s workflow, copying every row verbatim into schema_remediation_log first and printing what it acted on, and check_release_residue() withholds the stamp for as long as any remains, so a remediation cannot be forgotten; the harness gained a second lane that installs the previous release, attacks it and upgrades in place, which is the owner\u2019s actual upgrade path and was never tested. consume_share_link admits exactly what validate_share_link admits because both call one share_link_admission() rather than restating the conditions - the file test used to live inside consume\u2019s require_auth branch, so a soft-deleted file that validation refused still had a download spent against it. An org-scoped RPC is credited with a gate only for a call that binds the caller to the organization named: auth.uid(), current_actor_id() and is_org_admin() say who asked, not whether they may, and a function whose only authorization-shaped line was auth.uid() scored gated and served another tenant\u2019s parts over HTTP; the ten RPCs that hand-wrote the membership test now call require_org_member or is_org_member, and the gate probe takes its argument values from the function\u2019s own source so an input validation can no longer refuse the probe before the authorization runs. The anon sweep sees partitioned and foreign tables, column-level grants, and a table whose row-level security is on while a policy admits anon to every row - three shapes that read over HTTP while the check called the schema clean',
  94: 'An administrator can repair the per-configuration entries the pre-87 checkin_file erased, and the guarantee that a repair cannot destroy anything moved out of the caller and into the database. The offline script this replaces could prove it never wrote by showing you its imports; a button cannot be proven that way, so repair_config_maps() is written so that no argument makes it destructive. The merge is computed || existing with the row on the right, so an entry the row already holds survives however loudly the request disagrees with it and the key set can only grow; a key naming a configuration that no longer exists is carried through rather than removed, because removing one is a deletion and this function has no way to express a deletion; the keys it writes come from a constant in its body rather than from the request, so a request naming part_number is unseen rather than refused; and a map the row never carried is not created, because a row that never described its configurations lost nothing and filling it would invent database state rather than restore it. The row is read inside the UPDATE, so a request built against a stale snapshot degrades to a smaller repair rather than to an overwrite, and the receipt reports what landed rather than what was asked for. Proven by execution rather than by argument: harness/sql/repair-config-maps-proof.sql plants a row value that disagrees with the request and eleven keys for configurations that no longer exist, requires all of them to survive, and carries a sentinel that fails if the merge is ever written the other way round',
  95: 'The anchor every other gate rests on is finally held down. users.org_id and users.role are what is_org_admin, require_org_member and every membership subquery in this schema resolve against, and the self-update policy on users had no WITH CHECK - a policy without one reuses its USING expression, which tested the new row\u2019s id and not its org_id or role. One PATCH moved a viewer into another organization as its administrator, and every gate schemas 89-94 added then answered honestly against a row the caller had just rewritten. Both users UPDATE policies now carry an explicit check and a TO authenticated qualifier they were the only policies in that block to be missing; the self policy pins role and org_id to their pre-update values, and the admin policy\u2019s check is written out unchanged, because it is what lets an administrator manage a member\u2019s role and a stricter one there would break that and nothing else. Four more policies stopped depending on a clause that was never about authorization. A share link\u2019s file must now belong to the same organization as the link and the caller, and created_by must be the caller, so the table path can no longer mint what create_file_share_link stopped minting in v91; the only UPDATE a share link admits is its own revocation, where before a viewer could repoint file_id at another tenant\u2019s file or re-activate a link a remediation had just deactivated. Deciding a pending review needs module:reviews:edit, matching the policy that gates asking for one, and reviewed_by can only name the caller. Trashing a file needs module:explorer:delete rather than edit: deletion in this product is UPDATE files SET deleted_at, so an organization that deliberately withheld delete had still granted the ability to empty its vault into the trash. complete_gate_review enforced reviewer identity only when the review named an assignee, so any member could approve an unassigned gate through the sanctioned RPC; the rule for an unassigned gate already existed in get_my_pending_reviews, and both now call one may_review_gate() instead of keeping two answers to one question. The remediation that revokes cross-tenant share links computed the creator\u2019s organization and used it only as prose, so a link whose org_id agreed with its file\u2019s was left active and unlogged however foreign its creator was - it is a term of the query now, in the remediation and in check_release_residue together. Six authorization helpers named by eleven manifest rows are manifest entries in their own right, because requires is a substring search of the caller and a weakened helper left all eleven reading ok. The config-map repair receipt counts the entries a file that did not resolve asked for, so entries_requested minus entries_added stops reading zero for the batch that dropped the most. seed_customer_categories is withdrawn from the roles a browser holds, and the check that should have caught it stopped keeping a list of functions it would not look at. The function is SECURITY DEFINER and writes into whatever organization its argument names, and the REVOKE beside it named PUBLIC only - which on Supabase is a different privilege from the explicit authenticated grant that ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES puts on every function, so a fresh install was exposed exactly as an upgrade was and no application GRANT was involved. A user who administered one organization and a user who belonged to none both called it over PostgREST against a third organization and wrote 48 taxonomy rows into it; the write is ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING and returns nothing, so what it bought was the resurrection of taxonomy rows an administrator had deliberately deleted and an existence oracle for organization ids through the foreign-key error, not the disclosure of anything. It stayed invisible because check_org_gates() carried three function names it skipped, and skipping left no trace - an unchecked function and a nonexistent one read identically. The list is gone: an exclusion is now computed from the ACL in front of the checker, printed with the ACL that justifies it, and expires the moment somebody grants the function back. A function anon or authenticated can reach that the probe cannot show refuses a foreign organization withholds the stamp instead of being reported as inconclusive and then ignored. Two extension log sweeps are withdrawn from the roles a browser holds before either ever reached a database. cleanup_extension_http_logs and cleanup_extension_secret_access_logs are SECURITY DEFINER and delete by age alone, with no organization named anywhere in the statement, and the same Supabase default ACL made both of them live PostgREST endpoints: on a harness at this release a user belonging to no organization at all called one over HTTP and took another tenant\u2019s extension_http_log from one row to none, and the other did the same to extension_secret_access. Nobody was exposed, because neither function exists on any database yet - this is a hole that applying release 95 would have installed, not one that was ever open. Nothing legitimate calls them either: the retention path the application actually uses deletes from the table filtered by org_id and extension_id under row-level security, and no scheduled job or cron entry names them, so withdrawing the endpoint costs nothing and organization scoping would gate a door with nobody behind it. check_org_gates() cannot judge this shape at all - a function that takes no organization argument has no foreign id to be handed and no refusal to require - so the ACL is asserted directly instead: check_withdrawn_execute() names the five functions whose only protection is that no PostgREST role may execute them, prints the ACL doing the work, and withholds the stamp if any of them can be reached',
  96: 'Every schema file asks try_stamp_schema() after installation, so the last file records the verified release automatically while partial installs remain unstamped',
  97: 'An account could finish signing in belonging to no organization and not be told. v95 pinned users.org_id against self-update, which was right, but linkUserToOrganization still set that column with a PATCH whenever the email domain matched an org; PostgREST refused the write, the refusal was logged as a warning, and the org was returned anyway. The account then registered a user_sessions row stamped with that org - a table whose policy only checks user_id = auth.uid() - so it appeared in the online-presence indicator while being absent from Members & Teams and from every other query that reads real membership, and no admin could repair it, because the admin update policy is gated on `org_id IN (...)` and NULL IN (...) is NULL. Because the domain branch returned early it also never reached join_org_by_slug, so the org code such a user had been given was never actually used and they were never added to the default team. ensure_user_org_id() now resolves a pending invitation first and an email-domain match second for any account whose org_id is still NULL, honours blocked_users on both routes, and performs the UPDATE as definer - repairing accounts already stranded on their next sign-in. The client no longer writes users.org_id, users.role or pending_org_members.claimed_at at all: every route goes through join_org_by_slug or this function, and reads the column back before reporting an organization, so a link that does not persist surfaces as a failure instead of a working-looking session.',
  98: "Discard checkout could not restore a file's name. files carried only the lock columns - checked_out_by, checked_out_at, lock_message, checked_out_by_machine_id/_name - and nothing recorded where a file lived at the moment it was checked out, even though renameCommand pushes a rename or move to files.file_path/file_name live, independent of check-in. By discard time both the local file and the server row carried the new name, so discard downloaded server content to the renamed path and cleared the lock, and the rename survived. checkout_file() now copies the row's own file_path/file_name into two new columns, checked_out_file_path and checked_out_file_name, at the instant it takes the lock. checkin_file(), undoCheckout() and adminForceDiscardCheckout() clear both columns wherever they clear the lock; undoCheckout() additionally restores file_path/file_name from the snapshot first, since the rename had already been pushed to the server live, while adminForceDiscardCheckout() clears the snapshot only, since an admin releasing someone else's lock has no local copy to move back. Renames and moves keep propagating to the server exactly as before. get_vault_files_fast and get_vault_files_delta return both new columns so the fast and delta load paths carry the snapshot into the store.",
  99: "Two disagreements about how many rows a vault has. The first is between the client's file cache and the server: restoring a file from trash clears deleted_at without bumping updated_at, so a client whose watermark already passed the delete never sees the restore in its delta query and stays short until the cache's 7-day TTL, with nothing to notice the shortfall by. get_vault_files_count(p_org_id, p_vault_id) gives the renderer a cheap true row count to compare its merged cache against, mirroring get_vault_files_fast's SECURITY DEFINER authorization and predicate exactly so the two never disagree for reasons unrelated to an actual missed delta; on mismatch the renderer forces one full refetch, capped by a per-vault cooldown, to rebuild the cache from the authoritative row set. The second is inside the folders table. idx_folders_unique_active was byte-exact on (vault_id, folder_path) while every consumer of that table keys on folder_path.toLowerCase(), so on Windows - this product's only target - RADCAM and Radcam were two active rows describing one folder; one production vault carried twenty such pairs, and a single load reported 2015 folders and then built a map of 1995 from them. The index is now on (vault_id, LOWER(folder_path)), which is what files has had since v54. A unique index cannot be built while the duplicates it forbids are still present, so remediate_case_colliding_folders() runs immediately above the CREATE in the same file rather than at the module tail beside the other two remediations: in the other order the statement raises 23505 and the Supabase editor rolls back the whole module. Per colliding group it keeps the spelling the most active files already use, then the oldest row, then the lowest id, and soft-deletes the rest with deleted_by NULL after copying every row verbatim into schema_remediation_log; a folder with no case twin is never touched and a second run writes nothing. The three client functions that walk a folder's descendants - deleteFolderByPath, deleteFolderOnServer and updateFolderServerPath - matched them with a case-sensitive LIKE, which under the new index misses the very rows the index guarantees are the only ones there, and which also read an underscore in a folder name as a wildcard, so deleting Part_Files reached PartXFiles too. All three now match case-insensitively against an escaped pattern, and updateFolderServerPath rewrites a child path by splicing off the prefix by length rather than with a String.replace that rewrote the first matching segment anywhere in it.",
