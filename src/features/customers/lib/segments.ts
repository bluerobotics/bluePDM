/**
 * Lifecycle segments: how they are labelled, and the one client-side mirror of
 * how they are decided.
 *
 * customer_lifecycle_segment() in 60-customers.sql is the source of truth, and
 * anything reading the RFM aggregate takes the segment straight from it. Two
 * places cannot: the detail panel loads a plain customers row, and the account
 * roll-up combines several rows into one whose segment no query has computed.
 * Both go through {@link deriveSegment} here rather than keeping a copy each.
 *
 * Changing a threshold means changing the SQL function AND deriveSegment.
